## Design & implementation

___

### Main structure

### Architecture
{insert diagram to show architecture of code}

The ***Architecture Diagram*** above shows the high-level overview and design of the FitTrack app. 
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

**Tip:** The '.puml' files used to create the diagrams in this document can be found in [diagrams](./diagrams) 
folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) 
to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The **`Main`** class is called [`FitTrack`](../src/main/java/fittrack/FitTrack.java).


### Core sequence
Core sequence of code is written in [`FitTrack`](../src/main/java/fittrack/FitTrack.java) class.

![Core structure](images/FitTrackOuter.svg "Outer Structure")

![Inner structure](images/FitTrackCore.svg "Core Structure")

The App consists of five components.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Parser`**](#parser-component): Handles user input.
* [**`Model`**](#data-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
* [**`Command`**](#command-component): The command executor.

### Storage Component
API: `Storage.java`

Storage load and save functions are written in [`Storage`](../src/main/java/fittrack/storage/Storage.java) class.

![Structure of Storage Load](images/StorageLoad.svg)
The sequence diagram of the code for loading the file contents into each class.

![Structure of Storage Save](images/StorageSave.svg)
The sequence diagram of the code for saving data into file

The `Storage` component,
* can save user profile data in text format and load it back
* can save meals in text format and load it back
* can save workouts in text format and load it back

**Design Considerations**
* There are two methods to implement saving of data. Either save data after every command or save everything upon exiting the program.
* Option 1 (Currently implemented): Saving data after every command
  * Advantage: Data does not get lost if program suddenly exits. Changes are saved after every command.
  * Disadvantage: Slows the program down when there is large amount of data to be saved.
* Option 2: Save data once upon exit
  * Advantage: More efficient and better performance of the program.
  * Disadvantage: If program crashes, no data is saved.

### Parser Component
API: `CommandParser.java`

The [`CommandParser`](../src/main/java/fittrack/parser/CommandParser.java) is responsible for interpreting user inputs and converting it into executable commands.
It plays the role of connecting the user interface and the command execution components.

### Command Component
API: `Command.java`

The command component is responsible for executing specific commands and return a command result.

## Main Data Structures

---
### Implementation

**User Profile**

The user profile class basic deals with all profile settings and data. Storing, organising and calculating data related 
to the user's personal data is done in this class. All first time users are required to enter their height, weight, max 
daily calorie intake and gender before they can begin. For the categorisation of BMI, a hashmap is used.

**MealList**

The meal list class is used to keep track of meals and calories consumed by the user. It uses an arraylist to store the 
meals that the user has eaten, including the calories and the date.

**WorkoutList**

Similar to the meal list class, the workoutlist class is used to keep track of all workouts done by the user. It also uses an
arraylist to store the workouts, including the calories burnt and the date of the workout.

**StepList**

The steplist keeps track of the steps the user has made and store it in an arraylist. The user
inputs the number of steps as well as the date.

---
## Commmands

---
### 1. Add Function
The add function has three commands - `addmeal`, `addworkout` and `addsteps`. The three commands allows
the user to add their meals, workouts and number of steps respectively.

**Design Considerations**

**Implementation**

Here is an example of addmeal command which has 2 compulsory arguments `name` and `c/` and one optional argument `d/`.

Example:
```
addmeal chicken c/200 d/2023-11-11
```

Below are the steps that shows the implementation of addmeal/workout/steps.

*Step 1:*

The addmeal command instance calls ...

Example:
```
{insert code snippet}
```
*Step 2:*

Meal is added to mealList...

*Step 3:*

The added meal is then displayed to the user through the Ui


The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the {add} mechanism:
{Insert sequence or class diagram}

### 2. Delete Function
The delete function has three commands - `deletemeal`, `deleteworkout` and `deletesteps`. The three commands allows
the user to delete their meals, workouts and number of steps respectively.

**Design Considerations**

**Implementation**

Here is an example of deletemeal command which has 1 compulsory argument `index`.

Example:
```
deletemeal 1
```

Below are the steps that shows the implementation of deletemeal/workout/steps.

*Step 1:*

The deletemeal command instance calls ...

Example:
```
{insert code snippet}
```
*Step 2:*

Meal is deleted from mealList...

*Step 3:*

The deleted meal is then displayed to the user through the Ui


The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the {delete} mechanism:
{Insert sequence or class diagram}

### 3. View Function
The view function has four commands - `viewmeal`, `viewworkout`, `viewsteps` and `viewprofile`. The four commands allows
the user to view their meals, workouts, number of steps and user profile respectively.

**Design Considerations**

**Implementation**
Here is an example of viewmeal command.

Example:
```
viewmeal
```

Below are the steps that shows the implementation of viewmeal/workout/steps/profile.

*Step 1:*

The viewmeal command instance calls ...

Example:
```
{insert code snippet}
```
*Step 2:*

The list of meals are displayed to the user through the Ui.


The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the {view} mechanism:
{Insert sequence or class diagram}

### 4. Find Function
The find function has two commands - `findmeal` and `findworkout`. The two commands allows
the user to view their meals, workouts, number of steps and user profile respectively.

**Design Considerations**

**Implementation**
Here is an example of findmeal command which has 1 compulsory argument `keyword`. The keyword is the word
the user wishes to search for.

Example:
```
findmeal chicken
```

Below are the steps that shows the implementation of findmeal/workout.

*Step 1:*

The findmeal command instance calls ...

Example:
```
{insert code snippet}
```

*Step 2:*

Search mealList for the keyword...

*Step 3:*

The list of meals with the keyword will be shown to the user through the Ui.

The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the {find} mechanism:
{Insert sequence or class diagram}

### 5. Calories Function
{description}

**Design Considerations**

**Implementation**

{description of the command}

{example of input} 

*Step 1:*

*Step 2:*

*Step 3:*

The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the {caloriesburnt/sum} mechanism:
{Insert sequence or class diagram}

### 6. Help Function
{description}

**Design Considerations**

**Implementation**

{description of the command}

{example of input}

*Step 1:*

*Step 2:*

*Step 3:*

The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the {help} mechanism:
{Insert sequence or class diagram}

### 7. Handling an Invalid Input
If user enters invalid input, the app uses `InvalidCommand` class to handle it.

**Design Considerations**

Designed to provide an information why the user input is invalid.
Also, help of command is provided if the input command is known.

**Implementation**

*Step 1:*
If input command fails matching, command word is invalid, or any of command arguments is invalid,
CommandParser.getInvalidCommand() method is called.

*Step 2:*
Create `HelpCommand` instance to get a help message for the invalid input.

*Step 3:*
Use `HelpCommand`'s execution result and exception message to make a feedback to user.

Refer to [`CommandParser`](../src/main/java/fittrack/parser/CommandParser.java), [`InvalidCommand`](../src/main/java/fittrack/command/InvalidCommand.java),[`HelpCommand`](../src/main/java/fittrack/command/HelpCommand.java) classes for more information.

The diagram below shows the class/sequence structure of the {help} mechanism:

## Product scope

---
### Target user profile

People who want to be healthy by managing their diet and workout.

### Value proposition

Fittrack is a health management application which allows users to record their diet and activity, and help them to reach the goal they have set.

Fittrack also allows its users to calculate their total calories spent in a day and receive suggestions
on possible changes to their exercise, diet and lifestyle.

Users will also be able to calculate key parameters of their profile like 
BMI, ideal weight for their height and so on.

## Glossary

* *BMI* - Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms (or pounds) 
divided by the square of height in meters (or feet).
* People can lose or gain weight through a calorie deficit/surplus,
by providing them with a platform to easily monitor their calories 
throughout the day, this can make their weight loss/gain journey
easier.
