Main structure of the code and the parse feature is adapted from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2).

## Design & implementation

### Main structure


### Architecture
{insert diagram to show architecture of code}

The ***Architecture Diagram*** above shows the high-level overview and design of the FitTrack app. 
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

:bulb: **Tip:** The '.puml' files used to create the diagrams in this document can be found in [diagrams](./diagrams) 
folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) 
to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The **`Main`** class is called [`FitTrack`](../src/main/java/fittrack/FitTrack.java)

The App consists of eight components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [**`MealList`**](#meal-list-component): Stores all meals.
* [**`UserProfile`**](#user-profile-component): The class which handles all profile data.
* [**`WorkoutList`**](#workout-list-component): Stores all workouts.
* [**`Parser`**](#parser-component): Handles user input.
* [**`Data`**](#data-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
* [**`Command`**](#command-component): The command executor.

### Core sequence
Core sequence of code is written in [`FitTrack`](../src/main/java/fittrack/FitTrack.java) class.

### Creating a feedback for an invalid input
Refer to [`CommandParser`](../src/main/java/fittrack/parser/CommandParser.java),
[`InvalidCommand`](../src/main/java/fittrack/command/InvalidCommand.java),
[`HelpCommand`](../src/main/java/fittrack/command/HelpCommand.java)
classes.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the execute("deletemeal 1") call.

### Storage Component
Storage load and save functions are written in [`Storage`](../src/main/java/fittrack/storage/Storage.java) class.

![Structure of Storage Load](images/StorageLoad.svg)
The sequence diagram of the code for loading the file contents into each class.

![Structure of Storage Save](images/StorageSave.svg)
The sequence diagram of the code for saving data into file

The `Storage` component,
* can save user profile data in text format and load it back
* can save meals in text format and load it back
* can save workouts in text format and load it back

## Product scope
### Target user profile

People who want to be healthy by managing their diet and workout.

### Value proposition

Fittrack is a health management application which allows users to record their diet and activity, and help them to reach the goal they have set.

Fittrack also allows it's users to calculate their total calories spent in a day and receive suggestions
on possible changes to their exercise, diet and lifestyle.

Users will also be able to calculate key parameters of their profile like 
BMI, ideal weight for their height and so on.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Should be OS agnostic as long as it runs Java 11
- Should be able to handle 1000+ workouts and meals
- Does not require internet connection to run
- Should be usable for an average typist.
- Should be able to handle incorrect user input and provide feedback to the user.

## Glossary

* *BMI* - Body Mass Index (BMI) is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms (or pounds) 
divided by the square of height in meters (or feet).
* People can lose or gain weight through a calorie deficit/surplus,
by providing them with a platform to easily monitor their calories 
throughout the day, this can make their weight loss/gain journey
easier.
